Simple Servlet Collection is a collection of java servlets, such as web site, upload,
download, webdav, redirect, proxy, cgi and web start. You can use the servlets and web site
templates as-is or quickly create a custom servlet from one of the archetypes.

My intention in publishing this project is to assist fellow programmers
in reusing the code that I have developed.

It is released under the GPL3 License. To me this seems like the least
restrictive license. If you need another license, I will gladly create a
private release for you with that license. If you need a release, I'll sign it.

A few simple examples and instructions can be found at:

Enjoy!
